/*
The parameter list must not change: the overriding method must take the same number and type of parameters as the overridden method â€“ otherwise, you would just be overloading the method.
The return type must not change (Note: if the method returns an object, a subclass of that object is allowed as the return type).
The access modifier must be either the same or a less restrictive one (for example, if the overridden method is protected, you can declare the overriding method as public, but not private).
Thrown checked exceptions, if any, can be removed or reduced by the overriding method. This means that the overriding method can throw the same checked exception as the overridden method, or a subclass of that checked exception, but not a broader exception. This restriction does not apply to unchecked exceptions.

Checked Exp is free to throw any unchecked exception. Overriding method can not throw higher exception. Exception
If Overridden method does not throws an exception then overriding method can throw unchecked exception else compile time error
