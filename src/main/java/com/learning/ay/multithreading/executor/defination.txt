Thread.sleep() method internally keeps checking for Interrupt status flag.
public static void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException{
    while (/* still waiting for millis to become zero */){
        if (Thread.interrupted()){
            throw new InterruptedException();
        }
        // Keep waiting
    }
}
